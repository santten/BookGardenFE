#### how to use
import { Icon } from '@iconify/react';
<Icon icon="name"></Icon>
^ use tailwinds "text-color" attribute to change the color

### hox 
svg_icons won't be used in the future, instead we are using iconify library
the whole folder should be emptied later (except for the logo and other similar graphics)

you can refer to the figma design document for the used icon names

...or copy the current ones from here

if someone knows how to easily make it part of the tailwind theme then let me know - santtu
