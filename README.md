## some dev logging (to be moved later)

#### 7.9 main branch

- Santtu added the navbar: using Tailwind CSS and react-router-dom
- the navbar was done based on [this tutorial](https://dev.to/stephanieopala/simple-navigation-bar-in-react-js-4d5m) (although the styling is done differently via Tailwind)
- please make your pages in the files located in src/pages/*.js: if you want to add a page you can make a new file and ask Santtu to add it to the navbar
- please only use colors and fonts that are configured in the tailwind theme (they are directly picked from Viktoriia's design file)
- from now on we should start using branches: please push to a branch that is named after the feature you are working on
- thanks
